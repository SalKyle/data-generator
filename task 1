How Hardware and Software are used within Green Technology and Carbon Footprint
- Tesla

Hardware
 They have 4 products under their green energy line:
 - Solar Panels
 - Solar Roofs
 - Powerwall
 - Megapack

 Tesla's solar panels and Solar Roofs are designed to operate efficiently across a wide temperature range, from -40°F to +185°F. They offer high energy output, with panels producing over 405W of electricity. When paired with an inverter, they can store up to 7.6kW of electricity with a 98% energy efficiency.

 The Tesla Powerwall is a compact home battery system that stores energy generated from solar panels or the grid. It provides backup power during outages and allows for energy independence. The Powerwall 2, introduced in October 2016, has a usable capacity of 13.5 kWh and can deliver 5 kW of continuous power, with peaks up to 7 kW. The latest model, Powerwall 3, began rollout in September 2023, offering a significant power increase to 11.5 kW continuous output and up to 30 kW peak power, with an integrated solar inverter. 

The Megapack is a large-scale energy storage solution designed for utilities and large-scale commercial applications. Each Megapack can store up to 3 MWh of energy and includes an integrated 1.5 MW inverter, allowing for efficient energy management in smart grids and industrial settings.

Software
 All Tesla energy products are integrated with a mobile app that provides real-time monitoring of energy generation, consumption, and storage. The app alerts users to any issues or abnormalities in energy transmission, such as devices drawing more power than usual, enabling proactive management of energy usage.

 - World Wildlife Fund
 Software
They are to calculate the carbon footprint of a user by asking the user these following sets of questions which were classified under Food, Travel, Home and Stuff. The questions are as such:
Diet
Money spent on restaurants, takeaways, & fast food
How much food bought is wasted
Do you buy locally sourced food (not imported)

Mode of transport used most
How many hours a week is spent on the train
No of return flights (within the UK, within Europe, not outside)
% of flights offset

Type of house (detached, flat, semi, terrace)
No of bedrooms
How many adults live with you
How do you heat your home (gas, oil, electricity)
Is your electricity on a green tariff
Do you regularly turn off lights & appliances on standby
How warm do you keep your house during winter
Which energy efficient improvements are installed in your home

Bought any of these in the past 12 months (TV, Laptop or PC, Large item of furniture, washing machine, dishwasher, tumble dryer, or fridge freezer, mobile phone or tablet)
Amount spent per month on clothes and footwear
Amount spent per month on pets, 
Amount spent per month on health, beauty, grooming products, 
Amount spent per month on phone, internet, TV, 
Amount spent per month on entertainment & hobbies
Which types of waste do you recycle and/or compost

These questions allow the user to know which areas of their daily activities affect their carbon footprint and it manages to do this withoout encroachin gtoo much into the user's perosnal life. 

-Orsted
Hardware
Ørsted has established itself as one of the UK's leading producers of wind-based renewable energy through its extensive network of onshore and offshore wind turbines. The company's strategic approach to turbine design and placement is pivotal in maximizing energy capture across varying seasonal wind conditions.

Turbine Design
Ørsted utilizes advanced wind turbine models to enhance energy efficiency. For instance, in the Ocean Wind 1 project, the company selected GE Renewable Energy's Haliade-X 12 MW turbines, known for their substantial rotor diameter of 240 meters and blade lengths of approximately 120 meters. These specifications enable higher energy output while reducing the number of turbines required. 

Strategic Placement
The placement of turbines is meticulously planned to optimize wind capture. In the Hornsea Project Two, turbines are arranged in an east-northeast/west-southwest grid layout, minimizing wake effects and maximizing exposure to prevailing winds. This strategic arrangement ensures optimal performance throughout the year, accommodating seasonal wind variations. 
Through these deliberate design and placement strategies, Ørsted effectively harnesses wind energy, contributing significantly to the UK's renewable energy landscape.
