- Tesla

Hardware
 They have 4 products under their green energy line:
 - Solar Panels
 - Solar Roofs
 - Powerwall
 - Megapack

 the first 2 products have a resistance to a wide temperature range of (-40°F up to +185°F) and both having a relatively suitable size and a sleek design. 
 They also come with over 405W of electricity and when paired with an inverter, they are able to store up to 7.6kW of electricity with a 98% energy efficiency.

 Powerwall is a compact home battery that stores energy generated by solar or from the grid. You can use this energy to power the devices and appliances in your home day and night, during outages or when you want to go off-grid. This allows for smarter energy usage and storage of excess energy and the user is even able to sell their excess electricity when the main city grid is down.
